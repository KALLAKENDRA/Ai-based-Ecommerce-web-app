AI is being integrated into almost every aspect of our life from our smartphones, homes to transportation systems.AI is being used everywhere today. So we are building an AI-based Shopping system that uses a chatbot to perform all operations from adding, removing items to proceeding to checkout. This will be a web application with a backend server as well. This project is an attempt to provide the advantages of online shopping to customers of a real shop. It helps to buy the products in the shop anywhere through the internet by using the website. The customer will be provided the service of online shopping and home delivery by using this website application. This system can be implemented in any shop in the locality or to multinational branded shops having retail outlet chains. The basic concept of the application is to allow the customer to shop virtually using the Internet and allow customers to buy the items and articles of their desire from the store.
